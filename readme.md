# Adjusted Movement -- FoundryVTT Module
Enables the GM to better control player token movement.


## Installation
Simply use the install module screen within the FoundryVTT setup


## Usage & Current Features
- "Lock" tokens so players must request approval before moving (Uses the ruler measurement tool)

- *IMPORTANT* When the player is done selecting their path, they can hold the "ALT" key to prevent it from continuing to draw as they move to request Approval.


## Known Issues / Limitations



## Upcoming/requested features:
- Limit movement requests during an encounter to the player making the request
- All simultaneous requests
- Icon on Control Hud/Scene/Tokens to indicate that they are locked
- Limit movement to the maximum distance specified in their sheet.


## Troubleshooting
- I admittedly rushed this out the door; there will be bugs. Please contact me on Discord if you need immediate assistance, otherwise please open an issue on Github.
